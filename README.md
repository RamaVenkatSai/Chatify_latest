# Nodejs Chat Server - ES6 and Promise 

## Overview

This is a API and chat application using ES6 and Express with Code Coverage and JWT Authentication. 
Inspired from [Kunal Kapadia ES6 boilerplate](https://github.com/KunalKapadia/express-mongoose-es6-rest-api).
Follows [Airbnb's Javascript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

| Feature                                | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ES6 via Babel                  	 	 | ES6 support using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).  |
| ES6 Class based approach           | [ES6 classes - Jabascript MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).  |
| Code Linting               			 | JavaScript code linting is done using [ESLint](http://eslint.org) - a pluggable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Uses ESLint with [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb), which tries to follow the Airbnb JavaScript style guide.                                                                                                |
| Auto server restart                  	 | Restart the server using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) in real-time anytime an edit is made, with babel compilation and eslint.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Debugging via [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug)           | Instead of inserting and deleting console.log you can replace it with the debug function and just leave it there. You can then selectively debug portions of your code by setting DEBUG env variable. If DEBUG env variable is not set, nothing is displayed to the console.                       |
| Promisified Code via [bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird)           | All the code is promisified and even so our tests via [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).
| JWT Authentication           | Authentication is done using [jsonwentoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) and [passport-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-jwt).                       |
| Secure app via [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet)           | Helmet helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. |
| Uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) over npm            | Uses new released yarn package manager by facebook. You can read more about it [here](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360) |

- CORS support via [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors)
- Uses [http-status](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-status) to set http status code. It is recommended to use `httpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` instead of directly using `500` when setting status code.
- Has `.editorconfig` which helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jumacro/Chatify.git
cd chatify
```

Install yarn:
```js
npm install -g yarn
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
yarn
```

Start server:
```sh

# Selectively set DEBUG env var to get logs
DEBUG=chatify:* yarn start
```
Refer [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to know how to selectively turn on logs.


Lint:
```sh
# Lint code with ESLint
yarn lint

# Run lint on any file change
yarn lint:watch
```

Other gulp tasks:
```sh
# Wipe out dist and coverage directory
gulp clean

# Default task: Wipes out dist and coverage directory. Compiles using babel.
gulp
```

##### Deployment

```sh
# compile to ES5
1. yarn build

# upload dist/ to your server
2. scp -rp dist/ user@dest:/path

# install production dependencies only
3. yarn --production

# Use any process manager to start your services
4. pm2 start dist/index.js
```

#### API logging
Logs detailed info about each api request to console during development.


#### Error logging
